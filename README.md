# Movie Watchlist

Created a movie watchlist webapp that lets you look up any movie and it gives you basic information such as a quick overview, release date and average rating. I am using [TMDB] (https://www.themoviedb.org/) for the movie information. I also added a 'Trending' tab that shows the top 5 trending movies for this week. Finally, when you are on a movie page it gives you the option at the bottom of the page to add the movie to a watchlist.

The watchlist uses session cookies to keep a list of movies you want to watch. In the future I would love to connect the webapp to a database so users can keep their watchlist as long as they want and also have the ability to delete movies from their watchlist.
